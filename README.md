# 🌱 uvm32

uvm32 is a minimalist, dependency-free virtual machine sandbox designed for microcontrollers and other resource-constrained devices. Single C file, no dynamic memory allocations, asynchronous design, pure C99.

On an [STM32L0](https://www.st.com/en/microcontrollers-microprocessors/stm32l0-series.html) (ARM Cortex-M0+) the required footprint is under 3KB flash/1KB RAM.

uvm32 is a RISC-V emulator, wrapped in a management interface and provided with tools to build efficient code to run in it.

## What is it for?

* As a no-frills alternative to embedded script engines ([Lua](https://www.lua.org/), [Duktape](https://duktape.org/), [MicroPython](https://micropython.org/), etc)
* As a [sandbox](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Write_once,_run_anywhere) to isolate untrusted or unreliable elements of a system
* As a way to allow development in modern systems programming languages where a compiler for the target may not be available ([rust-hello](apps/rust-hello))
* As a way to [write once, run anywhere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Write_once,_run_anywhere) and avoid maintaining multiple software variants

## Features

* Bytecode example apps written in C, Zig, Rust and assembly
* Non-blocking design, preventing misbehaving bytecode from stalling the host
* No assumptions about host IO capabilities (no stdio)
* Simple, opinionated execution model
* Safe minimally typed FFI
* Small enough for "if this then that" scripts/plugins, capable enough for [much more](apps/zigdoom)
* Aims for safety over speed, bad code running in the VM should never be able to crash the host

Although based on a [fully fledged CPU emulator](https://github.com/cnlohr/mini-rv32ima), uvm32 is intended for executing custom script like logic, not for simulating hardware.

## How does it compare to the alternatives?

Many scripting languages and virtual machines are available for embedding in small systems and they all make tradeoffs in different dimensions.

uvm32 aims for:

* Small footprint (suitable for embedded devices, games and apps)
* Support well-known programming languages for VM code (with high quality dev tools)
* Ease of integration into existing software
* Flexibility of paradigm (event driven, polling, multi-processor)
* Robustness against misbehaving VM code

uvm32 does *not* aim for:

* Frictionless [FFI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_function_interface) (no direct function calls between host and VM code)
* Maximum possible efficiency
* The simplest scripting experience for VM code (a develop-compile-run cycle is expected)
* "Batteries included" libraries to do stdio, networking, etc

## Understanding this repo

uvm32 is a tiny virtual machine, all of the code is in [uvm32](uvm32).

A minimal example of a host to run code in is at [host-mini](hosts/host-mini).

Everything else is a more advanced host example, or a sample application which could be run in a host.

## Example

A simple VM host from [host-mini](hosts/host-mini)

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <string.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include "uvm32.h"
#include "uvm32_common_custom.h"

uint8_t rom[] = { // mandel.bin
  0x23, 0x26, 0x11, 0x00, 0xef, 0x00, 0xc0, 0x00, 0xb7, 0x08, 0x00, 0x01,
  ...
  ...
};

int main(int argc, char *argv[]) {
    uvm32_state_t vmst;
    uvm32_evt_t evt;
    bool isrunning = true;

    uvm32_init(&vmst);
    uvm32_load(&vmst, rom, sizeof(rom));

    while(isrunning) {
        uvm32_run(&vmst, &evt, 100);   // num instructions before vm considered hung

        switch(evt.typ) {
            case UVM32_EVT_END:
                isrunning = false;
            break;
            case UVM32_EVT_SYSCALL:    // vm has paused to handle UVM32_SYSCALL
                switch(evt.data.syscall.code) {
                    case UVM32_SYSCALL_PUTC:
                        printf("%c", uvm32_arg_getval(&vmst, &evt, ARG0));
                    break;
                    case UVM32_SYSCALL_PRINTLN: {
                        const char *str = uvm32_arg_getcstr(&vmst, &evt, ARG0);
                        printf("%s\n", str);
                    } break;
                    case UVM32_SYSCALL_YIELD:
                    break;
                    default:
                        printf("Unhandled syscall 0x%08x\n", evt.data.syscall.code);
                    break;
                }
            break;
            case UVM32_EVT_ERR:
                printf("UVM32_EVT_ERR '%s' (%d)\n", evt.data.err.errstr, (int)evt.data.err.errcode);
            break;
            default:
            break;
        }
    }

    return 0;
}
```

## Quickstart (docker)

The code in [uvm32](uvm32) to build a VM host is very portable and requires only a C compiler. However, many of the examples provided show how to build target code with different languages and tools. A Dockerfile is provided to set up the required environment.

    make dockerbuild
    make dockershell

Then, from inside the docker shell

    make

    ./hosts/host/host apps/helloworld/helloworld.bin

`host` is the command line test VM for running samples. Run `host -h` for a full list of options.

## More information

The best source of information is the header file [uvm32/uvm32.h](uvm32/uvm32.h) and the [tests](test).

A test coverage report is generated by running `make test` and is attached to each automated build.
